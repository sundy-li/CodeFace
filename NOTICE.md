# Notices

CodeFace Studio is an **unofficial** customization project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI**.

## Software license

The MIT License in `LICENSE` applies to the **software source code** in this repository (scripts, CSS, injectors, docs that describe the software, and the abstract demo asset generated for this repo).

It does **not** grant rights to:

- OpenAI or Codex trademarks, product names, logos, or trade dress
- Official Codex / ChatGPT application binaries, `.app` bundles, or `app.asar`
- Any user-supplied images or third-party artwork you drop into a theme
- Character likenesses, franchise art, or celebrity imagery

## Theme artwork

The built-in theme artwork is bundled into the native executable. The MIT License applies to CodeFace's source code and original project assets only; it does not grant trademark, publicity, or copyright rights in third-party names, likenesses, brands, or artwork depicted by a theme. Contributors must have permission to redistribute every asset they submit. User-imported theme images remain the responsibility of the user.

## Runtime

This project does not redistribute Node.js. At runtime it validates and uses the Node.js executable already signed and bundled inside the user's official Codex desktop application.

## Security model

Themes are applied through Chromium DevTools Protocol on **loopback only**. While a themed session is running, treat the local debugging port as sensitive: do not run untrusted local software that could attach to it. Use the Restore launcher to tear down the themed session and debugging port.
